🎓 EduPredict Pro: Making Sense of Student Success
Hey there! 👋 This is EduPredict Pro, an end-to-end machine learning project I built to help educators and students understand the factors that drive academic performance.

I didn't just want to build a simple calculator; I wanted to create a professional-grade dashboard that looks great (love a good dark mode!) and actually provides useful tools like batch processing and "What-If" simulations.

Why I built this
I wanted to see if we could use data to predict student outcomes accurately. By looking at 7 key features—ranging from reading scores to background factors—this app gives an instant AI-powered math score estimate with about 88% accuracy.

What it can do:
Instant Predictions: Just plug in the details and see the score pop up on a neon-accented card.

Batch Mode: I added this so you don't have to enter students one by one. Just drop a CSV file and let the model handle the rest.

Scenario Simulator: My favorite part! You can actually see the predicted "boost" a student gets by completing a test prep course.

Interactive Visuals: I used Plotly to create charts that show exactly how reading and writing scores correlate with math performance.

Direct Reporting: Built-in email support so you can send results straight to a recipient's inbox.

🛠️ The Tech Behind the Magic
I used a pretty robust stack to make sure the app is fast and reliable:

The Brains: Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression) with a custom pipeline for One-Hot Encoding and Scaling.

The Look: Streamlit for the frontend, styled with custom CSS for that "Midnight Blue" vibe.

Data Handling: Pandas for the heavy lifting and Dill to make sure the model stays "frozen" exactly as I trained it.

Charts: Plotly Express & Statsmodels for the trendlines.
